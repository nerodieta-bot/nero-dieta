 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset allows public read access to the /ingredients collection
 * and prevents any write access (create, update, delete) to the /ingredients collection, since it is meant to be populated and maintained by admins only.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /ingredients/{ingredientId}: Contains ingredient information (name, status, category, description, etc.).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access to the /ingredients collection is allowed.
 * - Write access to the /ingredients collection is denied.
